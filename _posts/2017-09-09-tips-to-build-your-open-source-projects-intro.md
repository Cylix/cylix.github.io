# Introduction

I don't like open-source: **I love it!**

I first started to contribute to the open source community 5 years ago during an internship at the end of my first year of study.
I was really anxious and excited at the same time when I opened my very first pull request!
Since then, I couldn't stop contributing and I now dedicate an important part of my free time to open-source.

Like many people, I first started to contribute to small libraries, then bigger ones once I got more confident, and ended up bringing some new projects I needed and was willing to share to others (if you are interested, you can check my [github](https://github.com/cylix) and leave me some feedbacks on projects that caught your attention!)

Open Source brought me a lot: not only it helped me to find tools I needed for projects I was working on, but I also learned a lot from it on both technical and social aspects. It also eventually opened me new opportunities by catching the attention of some recruiters.

I spent a lot of time on projects of my own, I learned a lot from them and I think it could be interesting to share part of my experience to help some other folks to successfully build their own projects!


# Before Reading
Please note that this article is based on my own experience, my observations, and of course some of my failures.

It does not aim to stand as a reference, but instead to provide some tips or observations I wanted to share with others.
Maybe some tips are missing or some people will not agree with hints listed here: feel free to start a discussion in the comments!

This article is not about how to contribute to existing projects. Lots of other blog posts already treat that subject very well.
This post is focusing on projects of your own. I've never really found articles to help me take the appropriate decisions and had no choice than to learn by myself.
