Hey, I'm Simon Ninon and I'm a French Software Engineer!

I recently successfully completed my Master degreee in CS at {Epitech.}, a French IT school known for its disruptive and innovative project-based pedagogy.
I also had the opportunity to study for 2 quarters at UC San Diego (UCSD), one of the top U.S. research university at the beginning of my Master.

I love coding and I spend a consequent amount of time having fun by contributing to open source projects.
Do not hesitate to checkout my Github to see what I'm currently building and what I already built!

I'm currently an happy software engineer at Whova (San Diego, CA), so I'm not looking for any job opportunities at the moment.
But if you wish, connect with me on Linkedin to be up-to-date concerning my availabilities.
